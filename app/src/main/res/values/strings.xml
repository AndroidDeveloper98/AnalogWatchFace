    <string name="description">This app is here to make it
        easier to install the watch face on your <b>Wear OS</b> watch. Once the watch face is installed you
        can uninstall this app from your phone. \n\n
        The whole project is open-sourced, so if you have coding experience feel free to contribute!\n\n
        If you enjoy using this watch face don\'t forget to rate it!\n</string>

    <string name="no_watch">It seems that this device doesn\'t have a Wear OS watch paired with it.
        \nSorry for the inconvenience, but Analog Watch Face can only be installed on Wear OS devices.\n\n
        You can also do it manually from the watch by searching for this watch face on the built-in store.
